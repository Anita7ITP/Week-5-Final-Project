# Week-5-Final-Project
For this project I plan to develop a social networking system, small scale for now!  The original plan/idea came from my personal experience at ITP. I was excited to join ITP last fall and was looking forward to meeting new people. ITP being celebrated for diversity, I was looking forward to making friends from different parts of the world. But I found it hard to talk to people aside class groups and projects. It was a very lonely time. Don't get me wrong, the majority of people here are really kind and cordial, but I wanted to make real friends, not just acquaintances. People I would freely talk to about our different countries and cultures without wondering if I was offending or approaching people who were not remotely interested in the same things.   

So the idea of the App came in, and after thinking about if a while, I decided to ask a few people if they would sign up if such a system/feature/website/app existed. Exclusively for ITP. Out of the about 20 people I asked, 19 said they would sign up for it. The only one who said he would not mentioned a personal preference of his, being off any type of social media. So for this class, I decided to pursue it and I hope the 'prototype' works.   

The idea:  The idea is to have a site where a person can sign up and choose a time he/she will be available to meet a random ITP person for about 1 hour. I insist, this is not a dating app. The purpose of this app is to have people interested in different cultures, meet up with others of like mind for say 30 minutes between classes and talk about these interests and curiosities.   

So I would go on the site and sign up. Then I would choose my year and hour of availability. The app would either match me with someone who signed up for the same time, or let me know no one is available then and ask if I want to wait or sign up for another time.   

If I'm matched to somebody, the app would send the other person, who may be waiting for a match, a message that they have been matched with someone and for them to confirm their availability.   

Design Tools: 

For the website design, I will be using HTML and CSS and Javascript for the front end. The database will be MongoDB and Mlabs. I'm hosting a local server on digitalocean
